      <h2>Notes</h2>


      <h3><i>Abstraction</i></h3>
      <p>
        <i>Abstraction</i> in programming is the idea of removing the complicated details from something so we can think about
        it in terms of simpler, bigger pieces.<br><br>
        <code>moveRight();</code><br>
        Is easier to think about than<br>
        <code>var e = document.getElementById("block");<br>
          e.style.left += 10;
        </code><br>
        even though they accomplish the same things. This is essentially the idea of <i>abstraction</i> in programming.

      </p>


      <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
      <p>
        So far, most of the programming we have been doing is what is called <i>procedural</i> or <i>functional</i>
        programming.<br>
        In this style of programming, the program script is executed from top to bottom inside a
        "main" function with some other helper functions.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Functional Code Example</u><br>
        <code>
          <pre>
var num1 = prompt("Enter a start number");
var num2 = prompt("Enter an end number");
findSum();

function findSum(){
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = num1; i &lt;=num2; i++) {
    sum += i;
  }
  alert("The sum from " num1 + " to " + num2 + " is " + sum);
}
          </pre>
        </code>
      </p>


      <h3>Object-oriented programming</h3>
      <p>
        Object-oriented programming is the idea of creating data structures in our programs that represent “objects” in
        the common sense of the word - “things”.

        Programs still have a main function and helper functions, but much of the program data and execution is handled
        within these objects.

        <i>Objects</i> increase the level of abstraction ultimately making it easier to think about how to build the program

        Object-oriented programming is modern programming
      </p>


      <h3>Objects - the concept</h3>
      <p>
        Right now, we can store data using specific data types: strings, integers, floats, and Booleans.
        It works, but it's hard to think about because it's not how we naturally think about the world.
        We think about the world in terms of whole “things” and then we can think about the pieces that make up the
        “things” and the actions that the “things” can take.
        This is exactly how object-oriented programming works. Objects are “things” and a new data type!
      </p>


      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Objects</i> have two basic parts:
      <ol>
        <li>The data or information that describes the object (variables)</li>
        <li>The actions that the object can take (functions)</li>
      </ol>
      </p>


      <h3>Defining JavaScript objects</h3>
      <p>
        In JS, object variables are called <b>properties</b> and the object actions are functions referred to as
        <b>methods</b>.<br>
        Objects are a new variable data type and must be <b>defined</b> (created) first, like any other variable.
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex;">


        <pre style="margin: 10px;">
<u><b>Object definition syntax</b></u><code>
var objName = {
  property1: value,
  property2: value,
  method1: function() {
    // function code
  }
}
        </code>
            </pre>
        <pre style="margin: 10px;">
<u><b>Object definition example</b></u><code>
var player = {
  name: "Nathan",
  health: 100,
  damage: 10,
  attack: function() {
    // code to attack
  },
  takeDamage: function() {
    // code to take damage
  }
}
</code>
            </pre>
      </div>


      <h3>"this" keyword</h3>
      <p>
        Properties in an object are essentially the same as variables declared using var, except they are “contained”
        within the object. This means, you can't refer to the properties without referring to object itself ex.
        <code>player.name</code>. In order to access the object properties to use or change their values from methods
        inside the object, you must
        use the keyword <code>this</code> to refer to the object.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Example</u>
        <code>
          <pre>
var player = {
  health: 100,
  takeDamage: function() {
    <b>this.health -= 5;</b>
  }
}
          </pre>
        </code>
      </p>

      <h3>Object definition example</h3>
      <p>In the object-intro.js file,</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Define a player object in the script section provided that has some of the properties we listed together
        </li>
        <li>Define a method to show an alert with the player's name and health</li>
        <li>Define a method to take damage (subtract some amount from the player's health)</li>
      </ol>


      <h3>Accessing JavaScript object properties and methods</h3>
      <p>
        After an object is defined, you can use the following syntax to access the object's properties and methods.
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex;">


        <pre style="margin: 10px;">
<u><b>Property access syntax</b></u><code>
objName.propertyName
or
objName["propertyName"]
(two different ways of doing the same thing)

<u><b>Method access syntax</b></u>
objName.methodName();
</code>
            </pre>
        <pre style="margin: 10px;">
<u><b>Property access example</b></u><code>
player.name = "Jason";
player["name"] = "Norman";
alert(player.name);
var hp = player.health;

<u><b>Method access example</b></u>
player.attack();
</code>
            </pre>
      </div>


      <h3>Property and Method Access Example</h3>
      <p>In the object-intro.js,</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use <code>alert()</code> or <code>console.log()</code> to print the object property values</li>
        <li>Access the methods</li>
        <li>Update property values and output the result</li>
      </ol>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Problem #1 - Pizza object</h2>
      <p>Define a pizza object that has the given properties and methods.</p>
      <h3>Properties</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>size "large"</li>
        <li>toppings "pepperoni and jalapeno</li>
        <li>cost 11.95</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Methods</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>show - uses the properties to construct a string that says "A large pizza with pepperoni and jalapeno is
          $11.95" and then display it in an alert or print it to the console</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Test your object by programmatically changing the properties and then calling the show() method. Your pizza
        object should print using the new values.</p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Problem #2 - Student object</h2>
      <p>Define a student object that has the given properties and methods. Use your own information for the property values.</p>
      <h3>Properties</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>first-name</li>
        <li>last-name</li>
        <li>age</li>
        <li>grade</li>
        <li>matric</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Methods</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>show-name() - uses an alert to display the first and last name</li>
        <li>show-info() - uses an alert to display all the object data. Ex "Xavier Soto, age: 15, grade: 9, matric: 081312390</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Again, test your object by setting the properties to different values and verifying that your methods still work correctly</p>
