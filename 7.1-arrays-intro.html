    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      To be able to declare an array with values<br>
      To be able to access and assign elements to an array using subscript [ ] notation

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Recall:</b> Variables are named locations in memory that we can store data in - essentially a box with a name
      we
      can put something in.
      <br>
      We've been limited though, because a variable can only store one piece of data at a time. If we needed to store 12
      names, we would need to create 12 variables. One to hold each name.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Arrays and Lists</h3>
    <p>
      An array or list solves that problem by allowing us to create one variable that holds multiple items.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Definition</u><br>
      An <b>array</b> is an ordered collection of data. The data can be any data type (int, float, string, boolean, or
      object). Each item in the array is numbered based on its position within the array, starting with zero. This
      number is called its <i>index</i><br>
      <br>
      <u>Syntax examples to declare array variables</u> (remember, declare means to create)<br>
      <code>
        <pre>
var arr = ["first item", "second item", "third item"]; // An array with three strings
var names = ["John", "Jacob", "Jinglheimerschmidt"]; // An array with three strings 
var nums = [10, 12, 0, -15]; // An array with 4 ints
        </pre>
      </code>
      The square brackets [] tell the interpreter to create an array variable. Each item in the array is separated by a
      comma.<br>
      We often use plurals to name array variables because they often hold multiple, similar types of data ex.
      <code>names</code> for a list of names.<br>
      <br>

    <h3>Array Terminology</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Array or list:</b> the data type that can hold an ordered list of values. In JavaScript, arrays and lists
        are the same thing. In other programming languages array is the basic version of </li>
      <li><b>Element or item:</b> the value of one item in the array</li>
      <li><b>index:</b> the numerical position of an element in the array with 0 being the index of the first element
      </li>
      <li><b>length: </b> the number of elements in the array</li>
    </ul>
    <u>Example</u><br>
    <code>
        <pre>
var cities = ["Tucson", "Phoenix", "Mesa", "Flagstaff"];
        </pre>
      </code>
    <code>cities</code> is the name of the variable that holds the array<br>
    <code>cities</code> has a <i>length</i> of <code>4</code>.<br>
    The first <i>element</i> in the array is <code>"Tucson"</code>. The <i>index</i> of <code>"Tucson"</code> is
    <code>0</code>

    <h3>Accessing and Assigning Values in an Array</h3>
    <p>
      To access (get the value) and assign (change the value) in an array, we use subscript or square bracket []
      notation to specify the index we want to access or assign to.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Example</u>
      <code>
          <pre>
// Declare an array of student names
var topStudents = ["Christian", "Kristian", "Shakka", "Jaime", "AJ"];
// Access the first element to store in a variable (index 0)
var student = topStudents[0];
// Assign the third element (index 2) to be "Alexa"
topStudents[2] = "Alexa";
          </pre>
        </code>
      <button onclick="example()">Run example</button>

  <section>
    <h2>Problem #1</h2>
    <p>
      In the function connected to the onclick of the button below, create an array of the top 5 places you would like
      to travel called
      travelList. Use an alert() to print out the element at index 2.
    </p>
    <button onclick="problem1()">Test problem 1</button>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Problem #2</h2>
    <p>
      In the function connected to the onclick of the button below, create an array named <code>numList</code> of the
      first 5 prime numbers starting at 2. Print out the items at index 0, 2, and 4.
    </p>
    <button onclick="problem2()">Test problem 2</button>
