  <h1>7.5 Search Algorithms</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      To develop and write linear and binary search algorithms with guidance<br>
      To be able to describe the efficiency of an algorithm using "Big O" notation
    </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>Search Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
      When you dont know whats inside of an array
    </p>

    <h3>Linear Search Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
    Linear search checks each element in an array for a target from start to end until the target is found or the end of the array is reached.
      1. get array and target values
      2. set a counter to i = 0 
      3. check if the element at arr[i] is equal to the target value
      4. if element matches, return index(i). Otherwise incerment i by 1 and repeat step 3
      5. if the index is greater than the last index of the array, return -1 to indicate the target value was not found
    </p>

    <h3>Binary Search Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
    Binary search requires the data to be storeded from least to greatest
     1. Sort array
     2. Set the low index to 0 and high index to length - 1
     3. Set middle index to average of low and high
     4. If the middle index is the target, return the middle index
     5. If the target element is less than the element at the middle index, set the high index to the middle index -1
     6. If the target element is greater than the element at the middle index, set the low index to the middle index +1
     7. Repeat steps 3-6 until low and high index are equal
     8. Return -1 if element is not found
    </p>

    <h3>Algorithm Efficiency</h3>
    <p>
      It is represented by how many maximum steps it would take for the algorithm
