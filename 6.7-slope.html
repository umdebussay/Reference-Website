  <h1>6.6 Scope</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to identify the scope of a variable</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>Variables have to be defined before they exist: <code>var text;</code>. However, just because you define a
      variable in one part of your code, it doesn't necessarily exist at another point in your code. This is the idea
      of scope. The scope of a variable is where it exists. The scope of a variable is determined by what level of {} it
      is defined in. </p>
    <h3>Global scope vs. local scope</h3>
    <p>
      Variables with a global scope exist everywhere in the script. To have global scope, variables must be defined in
      the root of the document (not inside a function)
    </p>
    <p>Variables with local scope only exist inside the {} of the function in which they were created. So, a variable
      defined inside one
      function doesn't exist inside another function. That is why you can have two different variables with the same
      name in different functions and why if you create a variable inside a function, you can't refer to it from another
      function. Parameters are local variables.
    </p>
    <code>
      <pre>
<span style="color:darkseagreen">// Root level of document

// myGlobalVar doesn't exist yet because it hasn't been declared
// The following line would produce a reference error;</span>
console.log(myGlobalVar);
<span style="color:darkseagreen">
// Variables declared at the root level have global scope</span>
<span style="color:cornflowerblue">var</span> myGlobalVar = <span style="color:peru">"I exist everywhere after this line"</span>;

<span style="color:darkseagreen">// Variables declared insided functions have local scope - only exist inside the function</span>
<span style="color:cornflowerblue">function</span> myFunction() {
  <span style="color:darkseagreen">// Local variable</span>
  <span style="color:cornflowerblue">var</span> myLocalVar = <span style="color:peru">"I only exist in this function after this line"</span>;
}

<span style="color:darkseagreen">// The following line would produce an error because myLocalVar was declared inside myFunction()</span>
console.log(myLocalVar);
      </pre>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>
      Use a comment to label every variable in the scope.js file as either local or global.
